/**
 * Answers one question about an access unit: does it carry a keyframe the decoder can start from?
 *
 * Recovery from a shed reference frame is only over when a keyframe actually reaches the codec, and
 * nothing else in the app can tell. Frame size is the closest thing - the hardware rounds identified
 * keyframes as assembled frames above a threshold - and it does not hold up: round 4 measured a
 * healthy stream whose true keyframes were 67-78KB against a 1.5KB median, with a scatter of 5-18KB
 * single-message frames in between that no threshold separates. Only the fragmentation pattern told
 * those apart, and only because that capture happened to have one. Reading the NAL type is exact.
 *
 * Round 4 checked this against the size method over an undisturbed session and the two agreed on all
 * three keyframes: same count, within 21ms on timing, within 10 bytes on size.
 *
 * ### Why this is safe when the last attempt was not
 *
 * Commit 66e59b2c removed a `waitingForKeyframe` latch that read NAL headers and held **every
 * subsequent P-frame back** until it was satisfied. It read them against the user's codec
 * *preference* rather than the type the decoder actually pinned, so on a mismatched stream it never
 * saw its keyframe, latched for the session and froze the picture with the connection healthy.
 *
 * Two things differ here. The caller passes the pinned type, not a preference. And nothing gates on
 * the answer: this only ever decides whether to stop *asking* for a keyframe, so a missed one costs
 * one extra request and a false positive costs one request not sent. Neither can stick, and frames
 * keep flowing either way.
